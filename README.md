A simple yet powerful Live Weather Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data using a public Weather API. The app displays current weather conditions, temperature, air quality index (AQI), humidity, pressure, sunrise & sunset times, and a 5-day forecast for any city entered by the user.

✅ Search weather details by city name
✅ Real-time weather updates using Fetch API
✅ Current temperature and hourly forecast
✅ Air Quality Index (AQI) display
✅ Sunrise and sunset timings
✅ Feels-like temperature & visibility info
✅ Responsive and clean UI design
